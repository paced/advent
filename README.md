# Advent of Code

This is my personal solutions repository for the Advent of Code problems I've done.

## Build Instructions

Everything should be doable using the Python 3 standard library. As a result, you should be able to
run `python run.py <year> <problem>` to print a solution.

Run `DEBUG=1 python run.py` to run everything at the same time.

## Philosophy

You will find shorter and faster solutions elsewhere. Here, you will find solutions that are:

- Fast (enough).
- Simple to read and understand.
- Extremely well-documented.
- Based only on the STDLIB and vanilla Python.

You should be able to run with `DEBUG=1` set to run all solutions at once. This should be fast.
